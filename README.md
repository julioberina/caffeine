# Caffeine
A game about caffeine and carbs written in Ruby using the Gosu game library.

To play the game, run
`rake play`

## Game rules

Once the game starts, you will see five yellow boxes.

Each box will contain one of the three items:
* Coffee
* Mocha donut
* Nothing

The boxes you are currently on is highlighted white.

To reveal what's in the box, simply press Enter when
it's highlighted.

The coffee will replenish 1 hour worth of energy.

The mocha donut will replenish 1 hour worth of energy for every 3 acquired throughout the game.

The game is setup to drain your energy every hour, so the goal is to last as long as you can
by acquiring donuts and especially coffee.

Once all you're energy is drained you will see how many hours you've lasted as well as an option
to replay the game.

That's all there is to it.  Good luck!
